        What makes a superhero?
    </h2>
    <p>

        A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person
        couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal
        human being could possess, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a
        fireman could be considered a superhero.
        <br/>
        For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detectiv e story or
        human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a
        superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being
        couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.
